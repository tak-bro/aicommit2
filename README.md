## Project Base & Inspiration

The core functionalities and architecture of this project are inspired by [AI Commits](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits).

## Supported AI

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
- [Huggingface **(Unofficial)**](https://huggingface.co/chat/)
- [Clova X **(Unofficial)**](https://clova-x.naver.com/)

## Setup

> The minimum supported version of Node.js is the latest v14. Check your Node.js version with `node --version`.

1. Install _aicommit2_:

```sh
npm install -g aicommit2
```

2. Retrieve your API key or Cookie

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- [Huggingface **(Unofficial)**](https://github.com/tak-bro/aicommit2/blob/main/README.md#how-to-get-cookie)
- [Clova X **(Unofficial)**](https://github.com/tak-bro/aicommit2/blob/main/README.md#how-to-get-cookie)
 
> If you haven't already, you'll have to create an account and set up billing. 

3. Set the key so aicommit2 can use it:

```sh
aicommit2 config set OPENAI_KEY=<your token> # openai
aicommit2 config set HUGGING_COOKIE="<your browser cookie>" # huggingface
aicommit2 config set CLOVAX_COOKIE="<your browser cookie>" # clova x
```

This will create a `.aicommit2` file in your home directory.

> It is not necessary to set all keys. **But at least one key must be set up.**

### Upgrading

Check the installed version with:

```
aicommit2 --version
```

If it's not the [latest version](https://github.com/tak-bro/aicommit2/releases/latest), run:

```sh
npm update -g aicommit2
```

## Usage

### CLI mode

You can call `aicommit2` directly to generate a commit message for your staged changes:

```sh
git add <files...>
aicommit2
```

`aicommit2` passes down unknown flags to `git commit`, so you can pass in [`commit` flags](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit).

For example, you can stage all changes in tracked files with as you commit:

```sh
aicommit2 --all # or -a
```

> ðŸ‘‰Â **Tip:** Use the `aic2` alias if `aicommit2` is too long for you.

#### CLI Options

##### `--locale` or `-l`
- Locale to use for the generated commit messages (default: **en**)

```sh
aicommit2 --locale <s> # or -l <s>
```

##### `--generate` or `-g`
- Number of messages to generate (Warning: generating multiple costs more) (default: **1**)
- Sometimes the recommended commit message isn't the best so you want it to generate a few to pick from. You can generate multiple commit messages at once by passing in the `--generate <i>` flag, where 'i' is the number of generated messages:

```sh
aicommit2 --generate <i> # or -g <i>
```

> Warning: this uses more tokens, meaning it costs more.

##### `--all` or `-a`
- Automatically stage changes in tracked files for the commit (default: **false**)

```sh
aicommit2 --all # or -a
```

##### `--type` or `-t`
- Automatically stage changes in tracked files for the commit (default: **conventional**)
- it supports [`conventional`](https://conventionalcommits.org/) and [`gitmoji`](https://gitmoji.dev/)

```sh
aicommit2 --type conventional # or -t conventional
aicommit2 --type gitmoji # or -t gitmoji
```

##### `--confirm` or `-y`
- Skip confirmation when committing after message generation (default: **false**)

```sh
aicommit2 --confirm # or -y
```

##### `--clipboard` or `-c`
- Copy the selected message to the clipboard (default: **false**)
- This is a useful option when you don't want to commit through aicommit2.
- If you give this option, aicommit2 will not commit.
 
```sh
aicommit2 --clipboard # or -c
```

### Git hook

You can also integrate _aicommit2_ with Git via the [`prepare-commit-msg`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg) hook. This lets you use Git like you normally would, and edit the commit message before committing.

#### Install

In the Git repository you want to install the hook in:

```sh
aicommit2 hook install
```

#### Uninstall

In the Git repository you want to uninstall the hook from:

```sh
aicommit2 hook uninstall
```

#### Usage

1. Stage your files and commit:

```sh
git add <files...>
git commit # Only generates a message when it's not passed in
```

> If you ever want to write your own message instead of generating one, you can simply pass one in: `git commit -m "My message"`

2. AICommit2 will generate the commit message for you and pass it back to Git. Git will open it with the [configured editor](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/associating-text-editors-with-git) for you to review/edit it.

3. Save and close the editor to commit!

## Configuration

### Reading a configuration value

To retrieve a configuration option, use the command:

```sh
aicommit2 config get <key>
```

For example, to retrieve the API key, you can use:

```sh
aicommit2 config get OPENAI_KEY
```

You can also retrieve multiple configuration options at once by separating them with spaces:

```sh
aicommit2 config get OPENAI_KEY OPENAI_MODEL CLOVAX_COOKIE 
```

### Setting a configuration value

To set a configuration option, use the command:

```sh
aicommit2 config set <key>=<value>
```

For example, to set the API key, you can use:

```sh
aicommit2 config set OPENAI_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

You can also set multiple configuration options at once by separating them with spaces, like

```sh
aicommit2 config set OPENAI_KEY=<your-api-key> generate=3 locale=en
```

#### OPENAI_KEY

The OpenAI API key. You can retrieve it from [OpenAI API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

#### OPENAI_MODEL

Default: `gpt-3.5-turbo`

The Chat Completions (`/v1/chat/completions`) model to use. Consult the list of models available in the [OpenAI Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility).

> Tip: If you have access, try upgrading to [`gpt-4`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4) for next-level code analysis. It can handle double the input size, but comes at a higher cost. Check out OpenAI's website to learn more.

```sh
aicommit2 config set OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
```

#### HUGGING_COOKIE

The [Huggingface Chat](https://huggingface.co/chat/) Cookie. Please check [how to get cookie](https://github.com/tak-bro/aicommit2/blob/main/README.md#how-to-get-cookie)

#### HUGGING_MODEL

Default: `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`

Supported: 
- `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`
- `meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf`
- `NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO`
- `codellama/CodeLlama-70b-Instruct-hf`
- `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`
- `openchat/openchat-3.5-0106`

#### CLOVAX_COOKIE

The [Clova X](https://clova-x.naver.com/) Cookie. Please check [how to get cookie](https://github.com/tak-bro/aicommit2/blob/main/README.md#how-to-get-cookie)

#### locale

Default: `en`

The locale to use for the generated commit messages. Consult the list of codes in: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes.

#### generate

Default: `1`

The number of commit messages to generate to pick from.

Note, this will use more tokens as it generates more results.

#### proxy

Set a HTTP/HTTPS proxy to use for requests.

To clear the proxy option, you can use the command (note the empty value after the equals sign):

> **Only supported within the OpenAI**

```sh
aicommit2 config set proxy=
```

#### timeout

The timeout for network requests to the OpenAI API in milliseconds.

Default: `10000` (10 seconds)

```sh
aicommit2 config set timeout=20000 # 20s
```

#### max-length

The maximum character length of the generated commit message.

Default: `50`

```sh
aicommit2 config set max-length=100
```

#### type

Default: `conventional`

Supported: `conventional`, `gitmoji`

The type of commit message to generate. Set this to "conventional" to generate commit messages that follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```sh
aicommit2 config set type=conventional
```

You can clear this option by setting it to an empty string:

```sh
aicommit2 config set type=
```

#### max-tokens
The maximum number of tokens that the AI models can generate.

Default: `200`

```sh
aicommit2 config set max-tokens=1000
```

## How it works

This CLI tool runs `git diff` to grab all your latest code changes, sends them to configured AI, then returns the AI generated commit message.
